  * A drone controller is an object that governs the behaviour of a drone.
  * It exposes a wide range of methods to query the underlying drone's state and give it commands.
  * You can inherit from this class and override the `onEvent` methods to implement a
  * drone controller with custom behaviour.
  *
  * NOTE: You should not actually use this class, but one of it's specialisations.
  * In Scala, use [[DroneController]] and in Java use [[JDroneController]].
